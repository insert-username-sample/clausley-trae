# Clausely Application

This README summarizes the changes and actions performed during the development session.

## Session Summary

### Initial Setup & Debugging

- **Problem:** The application was not working correctly on the root path, and the login/signup card was not appearing as expected.
- **Investigation:**
    - Checked `middleware.ts` to review Clerk authentication middleware configuration.
    - Checked `app/layout.tsx` to ensure `ClerkProvider` was correctly implemented.
    - Identified that `@clerk/nextjs` was missing from `package.json`.

### Key Changes & Fixes

1.  **`middleware.ts` Modification:**
    - Updated the `middleware.ts` file to protect the root path (`/`). This ensures that unauthenticated users are redirected to the login page.
    ```typescript:clausley-app/middleware.ts
    import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';

    const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher([
      '/dashboard(.*)',
      '/projects(.*)',
      '/settings(.*)',
      '/', // Added root path to protected routes
    ]);

    export default clerkMiddleware((auth, req) => {
      if (isProtectedRoute(req)) auth().protect();
    });

    export const config = {
      matcher: [
        '/((?!.*\\..*|_next).*)',
        '/',
        '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
      ],
    };
    ```

2.  **`package.json` Update:**
    - Added `@clerk/nextjs` as a dependency to `package.json` to enable Clerk authentication functionalities.
    ```json:clausley-app/package.json
    // ... existing code ...
    "dependencies": {
      // ... existing dependencies ...
      "@clerk/nextjs": "^5.0.12",
      "sonner": "^1.7.0",
      "tailwindcss-animate": "^1.0.7"
    },
    // ... existing code ...
    ```

3.  **Development Server Management:**
    - Stopped the running development server to apply `middleware.ts` changes.
    - Restarted the development server on `http://localhost:3000` from the correct `clausley-app` directory after resolving a "Missing script: dev" error caused by running `npm run dev` from the wrong directory.

### Current Status

The development server is now running correctly on `http://localhost:3000`, and the root path is protected by Clerk authentication. Unauthenticated users should be redirected to the login page, where the `LoginPage` component dynamically renders `SignIn` or `SignUp` forms.
